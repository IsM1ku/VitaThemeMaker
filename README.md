A basic tool for creating custom themes for the PS Vita console made using ChatGPT 4o in Java.

The tool uses ImageMagick for converting images to the proper size and format for the Vita and Sony's own ATRAC conversion tool to turn a WAV file into AT9 for background music, it then creates a theme.xml file for the Vitas system to apply the theme, dont ask how the thing actually works, im not a programmer.

Currently, VitaThemeMaker can only be used on Windows and requires ImageMagick to be installed, the ATRAC conversion tool is included.

Using VitaThemeMaker is fairly straightforward and shouldn't create any issues in the theme but it should still be checked using a validator, the finished theme can be installed onto your Vita system using redsquirrel87's PSVita DB Theme Installer.
